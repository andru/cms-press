It adds the flexibilty to have more than just posts and pages for content by allowing the user to register their
own post_types that can use their sperate theming from the post and page template along with its own permalink structure.

Along with custom post_types, CMS Press gives users the also register their own taxonomies.  With the addition of
custom taxonomies, a user can tag or categorize content separate from the default tags and categories.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `cms-press` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need this plugin? =

For most sites posts, pages, categories and tags will be enough to separate the content to the extent the user desires.  However, 
there are some sites that need the content to be further compartmentalized, like a corporate site having both a blog and a news
section.  

= What if I'm running WordPress v2.8.6 or below? =

Versions before v2.9 of WordPress do not support custom post_types, so there is no option for running this plugin in those releases.

== Screenshots ==

1. Creating a new content type of `Game Review`
2. Creating a new taxonomy of vGame Genre`
3. Editing a `Game Review` post.
